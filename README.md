Hello,if u see this,its 13 year old me

I made this account as a way to archive my coding journey.This can also be used as proof that I started coding at 13,which would make me have 5 years of coding experience if i code regularly until 18.Im not saying i will stop,but this would look crazy on a resume
I will come back to this readme whenever i feel like giving up on coding.

take breaks,but dont quit.Even your bestest of friends will feel annoying on a bad day,that doesnt mean u should stop being friends with them.Keep going,You love coding,you might feel like you dont,but deep down,even 13 year old you knows you love coding
